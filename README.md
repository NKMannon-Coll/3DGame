# Name: 
Fool's Gold

# Intent: 
The intent of our game was to create a priate cannonball throwing simulator with enemies and wave mechanics. 

#Narrative Structure:
The narrative structure of the game is simple you're a pirate defending his ship but with your cannon broken you can only fight back by throwing the cannonballs yourself. 

#Mechanics:
The mechanics present in the game are basic movement including jumping, the ability to throw cannonballs, enemy waves, andbasic enemy AI.

#Aesthetics:
The aesthetics in the game are a simple low poly design with pirates as the main unifying theme.

#Joys:
I really enjoyed one of the bugs I giot which spawned like 300 or so enemies when it was supposed to spawn 5 looked really cool. -Niko


#Struggles:
I had a hard time getting the raycasting to work correctly on the enemies for their attacks and am still not quite happy with how they work. - Niko

I worked on the Enemies. I implemented their AI and navigation behaviour as well as animating them. I also made the menus and connected all the scenes. - Niko
